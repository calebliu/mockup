1) As a user, I want to input my planned income and expense categories for a time period (e.g. monthly)
  a) As a user, I want the app to automatically calculate tax rates --> net income
2) As a user, I want to set concrete long-term financial goals (e.g. save $x amt by Y date) for the app to help me meet
3) As a user, I want to automatically upload my actual spending patterns and be able to compare it to my budget so that I can see if I'm on over- or under-spending in each expense category
4) As a user, I want to track my longer-term savings and spending trends by expense category
5) As a user, I want to measure my progress against long-term financial goals
6) As a user, I want to get intelligent recommendations for ways to change short-term budget to more quickly/effectively meet long-term financial goal
